            <h2>New York</h2>
            <span class="author">Carolina Garzon</span>
            <p> 
                According to the principal newspapers and encyclopedias, New York “the big 
                apple” is a big city, it’s one of the most populous and the most important city in the    
                world. Additionally, it is one of people’s most favorite city, especially for young    
                people. One reason is that this place has significant impact upon commerce,    
                finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education and entertainment    
                around the world. On the other hand, New York has been described as the tourist    
                capital; that is a vital industry for New York City which has witnessed a growing    
                combined volume of international and domestic tourists receiving approximately 49    
                million tourists in 2010, 51 million in 2011 and a record 54 million tourists in 2013.   
                Tourism has continued to generate an increasing economic impact upon the city,   
                exceeding us$55 billion annually. I think that New York should be to visit for   
                everybody, despite I don’t know it, I’ve been reading about this place and it looks   
                fabulous. I want to go and I hope to go the next year. Below I want to show you a   
                little of what you can find in this place.
            </p>
            <p>The Statue Of Liberty: everyone around the world had heard of this, but very few 

                people know their history. The Statue Of Liberty was a gift from France to the 

                United States, when U.S.A fulfilled 100 years of its independence in 1886 wiht the 

                French Revolution, it’s located in Liberty Island in the New York Harbor, in the 

                middle of New York Harbor in Manhattan, New York City. If you want to go to visit 

                to the Statue of Liberty, the best way is to stand on the ferry that leaves from 

                Battery Park in Lower Manhattan; it’s pretty cheap.</p>

            <p>Times Square: it is a major commercial intersection and a neighborhood in 

                Midtown Manhattan, New York city. Times Square is one of the world’s most 

                visited tourist attractions, hosting over 39 million visitors annually; approximately 

                330.000 people pass through Times Square daily, many of whom are either 

                tourists or people working in the area; one of the main characteristics of this place 

                is the large number of giants screens and neon signs that work all day and night 

                and that make the place to became a marvelous place. addition to that,  this place 

                has been featured countless times in literature, on television, in films including the 

                1980 film Times Square, which featured a punk rock/new wave soundtrack in 

                music videos and recently in video games, such as Grand Theft Auto IV, in which a 

                recreation of the Times Square area is included in the game’s fictional "Liberty 

                City" setting, and Battlefield 3.</p>
            <p>Central Park: is an urban park in the central part of the borough of Manhattan. It 

                was initially opened in 1857, on 778 acres (315 ha) of city-owned land (later 

                expanding to its current size of 843 acres (341 ha). In 1858, Frederick Law 

                Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition to improve and expand the 

                park with a plan they titled the "Greensward Plan". Construction began the same 

                year, continued during the American Civil War further south, and was completed in 

                1873. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. The Park was 

                managed for decades by the New York City Department of Recreation and Parks 

                and is currently managed by the Central Park. Central Park, home to over 25,000 

                trees, has a stand of 1,700 American elms, one of the largest remaining stands in 

                the northeastern U.S. A wooded section of the park called "The Ramble" is popular 

                among birders. Many species of woodland birds, especially warblers, may be seen 

                in The Ramble in the spring and fall. Today, Central Park is the most visited urban 

                park in the United States as well as one of the most filmed locations in the world.</p>
                            <p>Well, these were a little of New York, and these are some few places that you can 

                visit, but if you want more, you can visit the magazine Time out where you can find 

                more places or if you need to know about its Culture and contemporary life, Art, or 

                more about its economy you can find that in different newspapers like The New 

                York Times or the New Yorker. But   I think that nothing is better than you go  to 

                know, I am sure that you will not regret; by the way I’ve heard  Christmas in New 

                York is Wonderful.</p>

            <span class="author">Daniel Sanchez</span>
            <p>Why should you travel to the South of Florida? Many people think that Florida is just one  of the most famous parks and some beaches but it is much more than that. In addition, Florida has an important feature in its location relation to the rest of the country because part of the South doesn’t has too many weather variations and for this reason  it has constant warm weather  accompained by beaches sorrunded by the charm Atlantic Ocean. Five  days are not enough to visit Florida and you can do it with your family because it is not important how old or young you are to enjoy the incredible places and experiences.</p>
            <p>The most recognized and most frequently visited city in the South of Florida is of course Orlando.

You can spend all day exploring thematic parks like Universal Studios or Epcot, swim with the dolphins at Sea World or scream like crazy on the amazing roller coaster gardens Bush, to enjoy the beatiful beaches like cocoa  beach or visiting the facilities of NASA on Cape Canaveral.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, one of the most recognized cities and the hottest one is Miami. There’s night lifestyle due to the presence of Latin people characterized by their culture and personality. You can also see some properties of the celebrities like Shakira’s island or enjoy the amazing art deco architecture and if you love sports, the famous Miami heat equipment can offer you entertaiment.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, an amazing option is the beautiful canal-laced city, Fort Lauderdale.

            <p>The Akodessewa fetish market is the world’s largest fetishes and voodoo market, this place is located in Togo, Africa. The Practice of voodoo began in West Africa, before being brought to America by slaves. When We talk about fetishes, we refer to the talismans that are used in voodoo medicine, objects like crocodile heads, hands of chimpanzees, snakes and bones. Thus, the market looks like a giant pharmacy, and although there’s nothing wrong with that,  but can be difficult to stay calm between the tables where the smiling cheetahs heads, hyenas or humanoids skulls are  exposed as they were fruits</p>
            <p>Maybe you do not agree with black magic. Then, we recommend you the Sedlec Ossuary, one of the most famous chapel in the world it is below the Cemetery Church of All Saints located in Czech Republic.

            <h2>The Nasca Lines</h2>
            <span class="author">Nadia Patricia Rodríguez Pardo</span>
            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by the famous and mysterious Nazca lines. These lines are located in a desert of Peru between Jumana and Palpa.  Nazca Lines are discovered by Pedro Ceniza Leon in 1947. However some scientists say these were drawn by Nazca culture and other scientists say it is made by alien space crafts. These lines are created from simple figures until complicated figures. Some researchers say these lines are symbols for runways. If you want to know, you can see these figures from sky, you can pay usd 50 for a tourist service airplane.</p>
            <p>These lines are drawn on the desert floor with appearance human, animals, vegetables and varied geometric. According to the research these lines have between 5 to 30 centimeters depth and the floor has a double layer of soil. The first layer with red color and the second layer with yellow color according to the photos these figures are interesting for example the monkey 95m long, the spider 32m long, the hummingbird 168m long and the astronaut 40m long also in the figures, there are frequent repetitions, the most prominent example is in four figures with 17 km distance between them.</p>
            <p>The geoglyphs are on one of the hottest area in this area never rain and there is so much erosion. In the desert of Nazca rain less than 1 liter per m2 annual and the composition of the soil has significant amounts of gypsum preventing the wind can move or displace stones, actually the winds from the pacific are deflected by the high temperature prevailing in the desert. Definitely this is a place appropriate to draw anything that does not want to erase.</p>
            <p>The hypothesis of UFOs is based on a figure of a man with a helmet of an astronaut. At the time were made the geoglyphs astronauts were not known also the theories claim that the figures recorded from ufo ships with great precision using some kind of laser beam and especially a lot of figures have exact dimension. However they are messages left by aliens and earthlings must decipher.</p>
            <p>The most serious theory is that built Nazca lines were made for gods in the sky maybe on a communication system. These lines only can be seen from the sky why? If we stand on earth these lines are not understood. Maybe the aliens enter in communication with the Nazca Culture because some mountains are cut for to draw these figures. According to investigation these figures have codes for communication with aliens in case of a natural disaster. Last year the journal “new york times” asked Ms. Maria Reich, the scientist Germany said: “We will never have all the answers”. How the lines were constructed is a Mystery.</p>

            <h2>The best beaches in the world</h2>
            <span class="author">Nelson Camilo Chingaté Quintero</span>
            <p>When people go on vacation, they love to travel. The principal places that people love to visit are some beaches. The principal reason people visit the beaches is that they like to relax because most of the beaches are beautiful and have spectacular landscapes that makes them attractive and relaxing. In this world there are a lot of beaches in each continent, it is wonderful that people can choose which beach to visit. Now, which beaches are the best in the world?</p>
            <p>To begin with Cook Islands, they are 15 small islands in the South Pacific Ocean. They are located in the middle of Hawaii and New Zealand. In these beaches people can find a big jungle where some excursion can be done by visitors. The color of the sea is aqua and the sand in the beaches is white. The customs, food, dances and songs are shared by residents to visitors. In addition, in the islands people don’t have contact with technology and the problems of big cities. If you want to swim among corals, be relaxed and have adventures  like Robinson Crusoe, these islands are the best.</p>
            <p>Tossa de Mar is the second beach recommended. Tossa de Mar is in Girona Spain. There is a fantastic walled city. The principal places in Tossa de Mar are the beaches; people can visit them by car. The most famous beaches are Cala Bona, la Platja Gran and Cala Giverola. Cala Bona is 3 km from Tossa de Mar, It is a little beach in the middle of the big mountains, and perfect to relax. Platja Gran is the largest beach in Tossa, in this beach people can see the walled city. Finally Cala Giverola is 5 km from Tossa de Mar, has restaurants, tennis court volleyball and minigolf. All beaches have white sand and the sea color is clear water. Tossa de Mar is the best place to visit in family because people will find history and beautiful landscapes. </p>
            <p>The third beach is Cathedral Cove. It is in New Zealand. It’s very famous since it was a filming location for the movie The Chronicles of Narnia. This beach has a big rock that  has a shape of a tunnel that connects two beaches. When people go to the beach it is necessary to take a photo of the wonderful rock. Also the beach has some roads to explore the beach and the jungle, which makes it possible for people to go across the beach in one hour. Finally, in that place there is a marine reservation where people should dive. Cathedral Cove is the best beach to see all beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, choosing the best beach is very complicated because in the world there are many beaches. The article talks about three beaches but if these beaches don’t meet your expectative, you can find in the web more beautiful beaches in each continent that you can visit. In my opinion, in the world there are a lot of beautiful beaches to know, it is your decision which beach chooses according to your tastes.</p>

            <h2>World’s famous souvenirs</h2>
            <span class="author">Sandra Osorio</span>
            <p>For the tourists are very important to bring back good souvenirs for friends and relatives. The souvenirs are articles that are kept as a reminder of a person, place or event. People like to remind special moments in their lives and hold evidence of those special moments. However, it depends of which is the motivation to buy them. you can find two big groups: as objects that are generally associated with a particular region(clothing, collectables, postcards, refrigerator magnets, household items,etc) or memorable objects related to an event such as clothing or posters. This article contains the most famous souvenirs in some cities.</p>
            <p>In Amsterdam you can find a lot of representative thing s to buy but one of the most known is the STROOPWAFLES. These are cookies made in round shape. They look like "obleas" with appearance of grid. This product is one of the most exported products. In Colombia you can find them in the popular restaurants Crepes and Waffles. Most visitors bring back stroopwafles because they are small, easy to transport and very tasty.</p>
            <p>In addition, do you know why the taxis are yellow?. John Hertz was the creator of the Yellow Cab Company and he read a study where it shows that the yellow color is easier to see. Among so many fun details that exist in New York the toys of yellow cabs are very popular. These are an icon in the city. There you can find different designs. There are some more sophisticated than others. But the price is very cheap. By 10 dollars you buy a very good one and for sure this will remind you Robert de Niro in the famous film Taxi Driver. You can find it in a lot of stores on 5th Avenue near to the Empire State. In my opinion the taxi toy is a good gift for people back home, especially for children or simply to collect.</p>
            <p>As for ceramics souvenirs, many visitors go to Europe but they don’t know what to buy. In Portugal exactly in Lisbon a typical reminder can be TILES (Los azulejos). They are pieces to decorate made in ceramic, stone, metal or glass generally used to cover floors and walls in blue and withe colors. The more common tiles adorn the inside and outside of almost all houses in Portugal.  They depicted mostly floral patterns or religious scenes. However, you can buy little tiles with a lot of images of writings really attractive. Besides you can visit the National Tile Museum with the biggest collection of pieces. It was installed into the Convent of de Mother of God in Lisbon. Another good souvenir in Europe is the GUARDSMAN MUG in London. It’s a characteristic cup with the image of the famous British army guard. These souvenirs are very interesting and decorative, but they may not be very useful. </p>
            <p>As we have seen, the souvenirs are articles that you can't miss to bring as reminder. But, it's better be careful when you want to choose something because you may commit some mistakes. You can choose articles according to the person. In view of that sometimes a lot of souvenirs can be a hindrance and they end in the trash. You can think in things like clothing or candies. They are very common and your family and friends could be more grateful. But, remember don’t forget to come back with something. It is a good custom.</p>
